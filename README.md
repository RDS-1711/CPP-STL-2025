# Vector Key Points
> 1. vector.begin() returns iterator. we can't dircetclty print it. 
> But we can access the data in vector, it is pointing to by using *.
> 2. Accessing object return by begin() on empty vector gives crash. 

# Vector Methods
 - **push_back()** :  add element to the end
 - **insert()** : Insert element at desire position
 - **at()** : safe out of bound access
 - **emplace_back()** and **emplace()** : allow for dircet construction of object
   inside vector. other method like push and insert create temp object.
